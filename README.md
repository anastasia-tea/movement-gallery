# movement-gallery

This is Movement Gallery Blog, a practice website displaying a user's blog where, for a year, they post art pieces they enjoy from different art movements.
Each month focuses on a specific art movement that they enjoy, and every week, they highlight a new artist.

I thought this would be a fun practice project to expand my understanding of art history while making a website, and I am excited by some of the new artists I have found but also disappointed that so many names are new to me. This has been very meaningful and fun so far and has inspired me to keep up my visual arts practice.
